    <h4>The wind</h4>
    <p>knsdjn</p>
    <p>When the wind is blowing And your mind feels free In the secret of the desert Any of your chosen dreams Like a hungry unborn kitten You just try to feel free Into lands of hope and glory You will find long forgotten tree</p>
    <p>Oh can you feel the wind Blowing in your face Telling you that you Should win the final race</p>
    <p>If the men will ask you You should tell them what you're told Show them different views and aspects And convince the very old Give them food to feed their souls with Anything they want to eat Even if they're blind and desperate Future is a calming breeze</p>
